            <p>My name is <b>Stowe Busayo Olayanju</b> with student ID number: <b>ALT/SOE/023/2403</b> i hail from Lagos precisely
                lagos island(isale Eko), i'm the last child from a famliy of five
                i attended Glory Point International school for primary school education and then i got enrolled into New Era Girls Senior Secondray School(surulere) to start my junior educational journey where i obtained my junior waec
                certificate.i procceded to Gbaja Girls Senior High school for my Senior Secondray education(SS) where i passed my WAEC in one sitting. I gained admmission into lagos state university ojo where
                i studied biology education. i'm currently serving in Lagos under Ministry of Education, office of quality assurance
                Alausa Ikeja Lagos</p>

                <p>Reasons for joining <b>ALT SCHOOL</b> i joined alt school because of i wanted to have a chnage in career, a friend of mine introduced me into the world of HTML when i was 
                in my final year. I am not a computer literate so i vividly told him <q>this isn't mean for me</q> but then fortunately for me i started learning online,the exictement i had when i first
            wrote my first <q>hello world</q> knew no bound.i felt a fire ignited in me, i didnt stop in html but furthered more to learn css and having to debug code kept me up in the middle of the night.
        i love the community alt school is going to create already.
    kudos to our amazing tutor Mr setemi ojo for his well structured classroom learning. Alt school has provided a road map for software engineering and this was what i couln't get learning through various platform.</p>
   
<p> Someone once told me <q>Busayo you are not logical enough to do something relating to tetch</q>My Goal is to be a skilled software engineer, despite the fact that i don't have a background in computer science shouldn't stop me to be good at what i do, i want to be able to work on real
    life projects after the completion of my course with Alt school.<br>
    Sometimes it feels like its not possible to achieve my goals but i'm willing to dedicate and put in the works to break through into the world of tech. i want to develop a good communication
    skills and soft skills.</p>
